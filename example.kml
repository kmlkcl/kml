# Any message which is open by hashtag must be closed with hashtag which defines a comment #

# Types must be very simple as how much they allocate with an underscore at the beginning #
# An example type _8 (8bit)  _32 (32bit) #

# For each type there can be a type 'alias' which can explain how it'll be handled #
# Example bit_8=>byte #

# Here is a bunch of variable definitions #
# bit_8 a;             defined a variable called a and its 8 bits #
# bit_32=>int b;       defined a variable called b, which is 32 bits and its alias is int #

# Declaring a function #
# int <= function[FunctionName] <= (int a, bit_8 b); #
# !function[FunctionName]<=int; #

bit_32=>int;

# Fibonacci Example #
int <= function[Fibonacci] <= int x;

int <= function[Fibonacci] <= int x {
    if(x < 3){
        <= x;
    }else{
        <= x * [Fibonacci] <= x-1;
    }
}

[Fibonacci] <= 20;
